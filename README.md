Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
- Software Engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software systems
- It is important because it plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and suystems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment and healthcare 

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- Development of software programming languages. The foundation of software engineering was laid with developmentof programming languages. Early computers were programmed using machine codes or assembly language which were difficult to work with the introduction of high-level programming languages revolutionalised the field by making it easier to write, read and mantain code.
- Establishment of software engineering as a discipline. During the 1960s software development faced major crisis-projects were becoming more complex, expensive andprone to failure. This period often called the "software crisis" principles in software development
- Rise of Agile methedologies. By the late 1990s and early 2000s software development needed a more flexible, customer focused approach due to the ieffeciencies of rigid models like waterfall.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requiremnts
- Design: Creating of high level and detailed designs of software architecture and user interface
- Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specification
- Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements
- Deployment: Releasing the sofware to users or customers
- Maintenance: Ptoviding ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployments 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
COMPARISON
- They both are used for software development and project management
- They both aim to deliver high-quality software solutions
- They both follow a structuured approach with defined stages or iterations
- They both require collaboration between different teams (developers, testers, project managements e.t.c)
CONTRAST
Approac:
- Waterfall- linear and sequential
- Agile- Iterative and incremental

  Flexibility:
  - Waterfall- low changes are difficult to implement
  -  Agile- high adaptable to changing requirements

  Testing:
  - Waterfall- perfomed at the end of the development cycle
  -  Agile- Continuous testing throughout the process

  Customer Involvement:
  - Waterfall- miniamal customer sees the product at the end
  -  Agile- High  customer provides feedback regularly

  Risk Management
  - Waterfall- higher risk late testing can reveal major issues
  -  Agile- lower risk continuous feedback minimises risks

    APPROPRIATE SCENARIOS FOR EACH METHEDOLOGY
  - GOVERNMMENT AND DENSE PROJECTS
    These projects require strict documentation planning approval at every phase
  - BANKING AND FINANCIAL SOFTWARE
    Security compliance and regukatory requirements demand at a structural approach
  - CONSTRUCTION AND ENGINEERING  SOFTWARE
    Fixed grequirements and safety standards must be met before deployment
  - EMBEDDED SYSTEMS DEVLEOPMENT
 
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions
- Quality Assuranc Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans
- Project manager: Oversees the planning, execution and delivery

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Software engineering tools enhance productivity, collaboration and code quality by providing developers with feature such as code editors, version control, debugging tools and automated tesing capabilities. e.g:
- Version cntrol systems: software tools for tracting changes to source code and coordinating work among team workers.
- Testings frameworks: Libraries and frameworks for automating the testing process and ensuring software quality

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Changing requirements
- Tight deadlines
- Technical debt

Strategies for overcoming challenges include effective communication, Agile methodologies, prioritization of tasks and regular reassessment of project goals and timelines 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models.Prompt engineering helps avoid that by making your questions clear and specific, so the AI understands exactly what you need
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
